   --master      Same as '--branch master'.
   --patch       Patches to apply to source tree before building.

                 script files.
   --debug       Output all statements run by the script.
   --debug-dependencies

                 Remove also documentation files and other support files
                 from the dependencies file. Activate --compress and

   --without-*   Remove requested feature in the dependencies and build.
   --threads n   Build using 'n' threads.
